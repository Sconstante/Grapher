Visual graphs and DFS, BFS, Kruskal algorithms in Java

Grapher is a project that allows visualizing and traversing graphs using towers and cables to represent nodes and edges. This project is developed in Java with Java Swing and utilizes the DFS (Depth-First Search) and BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithms, as well as the Kruskal's algorithm to find the shortest path that connects all nodes.

## Features

- Interactive visualization of graphs using graphical representation with towers and cables.
- Implementation of DFS and BFS algorithms for graph traversal.
- Utilization of Kruskal's algorithm to find the shortest path.
- Intuitive graphical interface to interact with graphs and execute algorithms.

## Visuals

Here are some visuals that illustrate the interface and algorithms in action:

## System Requirements

- Java (version 1.8.0_241)

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/salo368/Grapher.git`
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.
3. Compile and run the program.
4. Interact with the graphical interface to add nodes and edges, execute traversal algorithms, and find the shortest path.
